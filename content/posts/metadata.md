Hi, I'm **Faiz Halde**. I'm a software engineer for almost a decade now. That's right, saying "10 years" just doesn't pack the same punch, folks. 

I work for **@nubank**, I've also worked for Paypal & Helpshift

I have a deep interest in <span class="underline">Distributed Systems</span>, <span class="underline">Databases</span>, <span class="underline">System Performance</span> & in recent times with all facets of devops & big-data.

I don't discriminate programming languages however <span class="underline">Clojure</span>, Scala, <span class="underline">Golang</span> & Java are my current beloved.

That being said, I have also worked with,
- Monoliths / Microservices <span class="highlight">¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯</span>

- Apache Spark
- Elasticsearch – ELK stack
- Kafka
- IaC – Terraform
